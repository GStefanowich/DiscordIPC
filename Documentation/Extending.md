Given these changes and problems, it doesn't mean they can't be fixed. DiscordIPC exposes some internal mechanism for the application developer to use themselves in case these problems occur. Most problems are type related, i.e. the data returned by the IPC may not match the expected type (some properties may be unmatched).

If you look carefully, you'll see that `DiscordIPC` extends `LowLevelDiscordIPC` and just provides overloads for different types. In case these types don't match the return types, you can extend `LowLevelDiscordIPC` and implement those methods yourself. Internally DiscordIPC works with `dynamic` data types and adds necessary casts and conversions when interfacing with user code. These methods are the "weak type" methods (e.g. `SendCommandWeakTypeAsync`); Implementing these methods yourself means you'll be dealing with `dynamic` data types and it's your responsibility to add correct casts wherever necessary. Failure to do so will result in runtime exceptions. `DiscordIPC` was provided to move these exception from runtime to compile-time, as it adds the necessary casts internally, so you're basically letting go of the security provided by it by implementing your own `LowLevelDiscordIPC`.
